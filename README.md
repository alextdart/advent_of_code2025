# Advent of Code 2025
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2025/about)

This year I want to take on the Advent of Code daily coding puzzles for the month of December, although this year it's been cut down to only 12 puzzles (each with two parts, though) instead of 24 days.

No using AI or looking at any solutions until after completing the puzzles for the first time. Only to confirm or for learning, to see if there were better ways afterwards.
